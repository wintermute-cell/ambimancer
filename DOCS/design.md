# This is a brief description of the overall layout of the GUI.

## Views
The GUI is split in the following 2 views.

### Main-View
The first view, 'main' contains a collection of all available ambiences, each one with a configurable icon, a name, and a number of user specified tags.
The ambiences can be searched by name, and/or by tag.

New Ambiences can be created here by pressing a button on the right.
This then brings up the edit-view.

Already existing tabs can either be started to play in parallel to the current Ambiences, or to fade out all other ambiences and play alone.

### Edit-View
This view contains a file-browser, where tracks can be selected from the soundfiles folder.

The selected tracks can then be added to the current Ambience.
      Each track added has its own parameters for volume, frequency, etc...

If only a single track is selected, it can be preview-played.

This view also contains general settings for the Ambience, like overall volume modifier, name, tags, etc...
